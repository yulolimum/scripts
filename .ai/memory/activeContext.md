# Active Context: @yulolimum/scripts

## Current Work Focus

### Memory Bank Initialization (In Progress)
- **Status**: Creating comprehensive memory bank structure
- **Completed**: Project analysis, core documentation files
- **Next**: Complete remaining core files (activeContext.md, progress.md)

### Project State Analysis

#### Current Functionality
All three core scripts are **fully functional** and ready for use:

1. **dev-check-code-quality.mjs**: Interactive code quality runner
   - TypeScript type checking
   - ESLint linting with auto-fix
   - Prettier formatting
   - User preference caching
   - Selective tool execution

2. **dev-clean.sh**: Project cleanup utility
   - Removes development artifacts (.DS_Store, caches)
   - Cleans build outputs (node_modules, dist, .next, .expo)
   - Safe execution with error tolerance

3. **dev-verify-software.sh**: Environment verification
   - Validates required development tools
   - Version range checking (Node.js 22.x, Java 17.x, etc.)
   - Comprehensive reporting

## Recent Changes

### Memory Bank Creation (Current Session)
- Created `.ai/memory/` directory structure
- Documented project brief, product context, system patterns, and tech context
- Established foundation for future development tracking

### Project Configuration
- Modern tooling setup with pnpm, TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier
- React development support through ESLint plugins
- Strict TypeScript configuration for maximum type safety

## Next Steps

### Immediate (This Session)
1. Complete `progress.md` to document current project status
2. Finalize memory bank initialization
3. Document any additional context or patterns discovered

### Short-term Development Opportunities
1. **Enhanced Error Reporting**: Improve error messages with actionable suggestions
2. **Configuration Validation**: Add checks for missing or invalid tool configurations
3. **Performance Optimization**: Implement parallel tool execution where safe
4. **Cross-Project Usage**: Add support for running scripts from any directory

### Medium-term Enhancements
1. **Plugin Architecture**: Allow custom tool integration
2. **Configuration Profiles**: Support different tool combinations for different project types
3. **CI/CD Integration**: Add support for automated environments
4. **Reporting**: Generate detailed reports of code quality metrics

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### User Experience Priorities
- **Simplicity**: Keep scripts easy to understand and use
- **Reliability**: Ensure consistent behavior across different environments
- **Feedback**: Provide clear, actionable feedback for all operations
- **Performance**: Maintain fast execution times

### Technical Architecture
- **Independence**: Each script should work standalone
- **Consistency**: Shared patterns for error handling and user feedback
- **Extensibility**: Design for future enhancement without breaking changes
- **Compatibility**: Support both individual and team development workflows

### Quality Standards
- **Code Quality**: All scripts follow project's own quality standards
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation for maintenance
- **Testing**: Consider adding automated tests for critical functionality
- **Security**: Safe execution patterns, no arbitrary code execution

## Important Patterns and Preferences

### CLI Design Patterns
- **Interactive Selection**: Use checkboxes for multi-option choices
- **Smart Defaults**: Remember user preferences to reduce friction
- **Visual Feedback**: Spinners for long operations, clear success/error indicators
- **Graceful Degradation**: Continue operation when individual tools fail

### Error Handling Philosophy
- **Fail Fast**: Exit immediately on critical errors
- **Graceful Recovery**: Continue when possible, report issues clearly
- **User Guidance**: Provide actionable error messages
- **Debugging Support**: Include relevant output for troubleshooting

### Configuration Management
- **Local Caching**: Store user preferences in script directory
- **Project Integration**: Respect existing project configurations
- **Sensible Defaults**: Work out-of-the-box with minimal setup
- **Override Capability**: Allow user customization when needed

## Learnings and Project Insights

### Development Workflow Integration
- Scripts are designed to complement existing development workflows
- Package.json integration provides familiar npm/pnpm script interface
- Flexible execution supports both interactive and automated usage

### Tool Chain Evolution
- Modern ESLint flat config format adoption
- TypeScript strictest configuration for maximum safety
- React development support through comprehensive plugin setup
- Prettier integration for consistent code formatting

### Cross-Platform Considerations
- Primary focus on macOS development environment
- POSIX-compatible shell commands for broader compatibility
- ZX framework provides cross-platform JavaScript shell scripting
- Graceful handling of missing tools or platform differences

### Performance and Efficiency
- Caching strategies reduce repeated user input
- Sequential tool execution provides clear feedback
- Minimal dependency footprint for fast installation
- Built-in tool caching (ESLint, Prettier) for improved performance
